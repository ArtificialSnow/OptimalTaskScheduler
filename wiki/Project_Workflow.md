# Project Workflow
This page documents the organization and distribution of the project.
## Project Timeline
The Gantt chart below shows the expected timeline for the completion of the
tasks needed for the project:

## Meetings
Team meetings were conducted in person on a regular basis (3+ times a week). 
These moved to online meetings via Discord during the level 3 lockdown in Auckland.
Meetings were organized by the team leader, Peter.
Outcomes of the meetings were documented on Google Drive.

## Collaboration Tools
- GitHub was used for version control.
- Both Discord and Google Drive were used for file sharing.
- Discord was the primary means of communication.
- The issue tracker on GitHub was used for delegation and record-keeping of tasks.

## Workflow Distribution
### Milestone 1
[Milestone 1](Milestone1.md) was separated into three main sections which could be
worked on in parallel. These were distributed as follows:
- I/O parsing (Peter, Sheldon)
- Valid schedule implementation (Tushar, Yuno)
- Validity testing (Elisa)

Planning of skeletal code, defining interfaces between sections, writing documentation, 
and selecting the valid solution strategy was done as a team.

### Milestone 2
The workload of [Milestone 2](Milestone2.md) was separated into 5 main sections. In this
milestone, our team worked together a significant amount of the time, and many parts of
the project was implemented with peer programming and individuals switching between
the sections. The sections and their main contributors were:
- Algorithm (Peter, Sheldon, Elisa)
- Visualization (Tushar, Yuno)
- Parallelization (Tushar, Yuno, Sheldon)
- Testing (Elisa, Peter)
- Documentation (Everyone)

The [algorithm](Optimal_Scheduling.md) and [visualization](Visualization.md) was implemented in parallel, once skeleton code how the
two sections were to interact (e.g. places where visualization would receive information
from the solution) were agreed upon. 

After the algorithm and visualization parts were mostly done, the 
[parallelization](Parallelisation.md) and [testing](Testing.md) sections were 
implemented in parallel. 

Documentation was added to this Wiki throughout the project, by the individuals that
worked on the respective sections.
