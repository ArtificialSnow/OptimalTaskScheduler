# Optimal Scheduling

## Solution

## Optimisation

### Pre-Processing
* #### Node Duplication
Nodes that are equivalent from the start of the algorithm, will stay equivalent throughout the run time of the algorithm. Therefore, it is safe to precalculate for each node, the nodes thate are 
equivalent to it. An array list of equivilent nodes to node n is kept in index n in a array and used within the algorithm for pruning/optimization purposes. 

* #### Initial Greedy Schedule

Initially, when the algorithm runs, the current best finish time for any schedule is infinity. Some pruning techniques under-estimate the finish time for a schedule represented by 
this state and compare it to the current best, if the estimate is greater than the best it means that this state doesnt need to be further explored. If the initial best time is infinity, then untill a 
complete valid schedule is found, the pruning techniques mentioned earlier will not have any affect. To get around this problem, we run a greedy algorithm that recursively schedules the highest priority free
node to the earliest available processer untill there are no more tasks to schedule. At this point, there is a non infinite valid schedule which will be used as the initial best finish time for any schedule for 
the main algorithm. 

* #### Max Length to Exit Node
The b-level of a node stays constant throughout the running of the algorithm. It is safe to pre-calculate these and store them in an array. 

### Recursive Search and Backtracking

Initially, the given graph will have a set of nodes that can be run immediately. These nodes are passed into a recursive function. In turn, for every free task t, we try, in turn, to schedule t on all processors p at the earliest possible 
time. Before the recursive call, we update the state to correctly reflect the fact that t has been scheduled. This includes updating the set of free nodes, the time that the processers are available, the in degree of t's children and 
a few other pieces of information that is used for optimisation. Once the recursive call has returned, we revert the changes made to the state.

#### Order

Tasks are scheduled in order of their b-level value. Minimum b-level tasks will be scheduled before larger ones. 

### Pruning
Since our search space is exponential, we need to find methods to prune this search space such that it becomes manageable for us to search and find the optimal schedule.

* #### Partial equivalent solutions
   
    The same order of tasks on processes may reoccur from the exploration of different states.
    
    Given a set of free tasks {a, b, c}, suppose that we want to schedule task 'a' on processor at index i. If 'a' has no children, then scheduling b on any processor less than i in the next recursive call will result in the algorithm exploring the same partial state twice. 
    The reason for this is that node b will eventually get to be scheduled on processors indexed less than i-1 in the initial state and when it recurses, a will get to be scheduled on processors greater than the one b is on. 
    
* #### Fixed Task Order (FTO)
   Suppose we are in the process of scheduling our tasks. Let us call the list of tasks where there are either no dependencies, or their dependencies have been completed, our list of candidateTasks. These are the tasks that can currently be scheduled.
   
   There are special structures that can be present in a task graph such that we can fix the order of our tasks.
   
   These structures must fulfill several conditions:
   1. All the candidateTasks must have at most one parent and at most one child.
   2. All the candidateTasks must have either no child or the same child.
   3. All the candidateTasks must have either no parent, or their parents are scheduled on the same processor.
   4. The candidateTasks list can be sorted such that the list fulfills the following two conditions. This will be the fixed task order.
        1. The tasks in the list are in non-decreasing data ready time. `Data ready time = finish time of parent + communication cost of parent to the task`.
        2. The tasks in the list are in non-increasing out-edge costs. `Out-edge cost = communication cost of task to its child`, or 0 if the task does not have a child.
     
   The fixed task order means that among the tasks in candidateTasks, an optimal solution should contain these tasks scheduled in this order. By fixing the task order, we are able to prune our tree by a factor of the number of tasks in candidateTasks, as we no longer need to check every single ordering. 
   
   The fixed task order works because scheduling tasks in non-decreasing data ready time ensures the minimalisation of idle time of processors, and the scheduling of tasks in non-increasing out-edge costs ensures that the start time of any tasks that depend on our set of candidateTasks (which should be all tasks that are not currently scheduled and not in candidateTasks by definition) can be minimalised. [More details here.](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305054813002542)
   
   Once we get a FTO, we know that we can schedule the first task in our FTO safely. However, once the first task is scheduled, this may make changes to our list of candidate tasks. More specifically, if the task has a child, and the child becomes a candidate task, our candidateTasks may no longer form a valid FTO. For example, if the newly added child has two different children, our candidateTasks list would no longer satisfy condition i) for a FTO. If the scheduled task doesn't have a child however, our candidateTasks without the first scheduled task will still form a FTO because non of the conditions i), ii), iii) will be violated by the current tasks in candidateTasks, and the list is already in the order specified by iv).
   
* #### Load Balancing
    The load balanced time (LBT) is the minimum remaining time if all the remaining unscheduled tasks are spread evenly amongst the processors, not including communication costs. LBT = sum(unscheduled task durations) / number of processors.
    
    Since the LBT is a minimum bound on the finish time of the current schedule, if `LBT + earliest time we can schedule the next task` is greater than the current best schedule, we know that the current schedule can't become an optimal schedule and we can safely return from this state.

* #### B Levels
    A B level of a node is the sum of its run time plus the maxiumum path to an exit node from its self. We can use the B level of a node to under estimate the finishing time of the optimal schedule. 
    
    The under estimate for the finishing time of the optimal schedule if we want to schedule task i on processor j is: `earliest Start Time of task i on processor j + B Level of task i`. 
    
    The reason why we can guarantee that this estimate is an under estimate is because all the descendants of node i must be scheduled after or at the finish time of i. 
    
* #### Latest Processor Finishing Time
    The latest processor finishing time is the finishing time of a processor such that it is the largest among all processors. 
    
    We stop considering this state if the largest processor finishing time is greater than the current best schedule end time.

* #### Processor Normalization
    Two processors are isomorphic if they do not have any tasks scheduled on them. Scheduling a task on multiple isomorphic processors produces the same resultant state.
    
    In our algorithm, within a given state, we check if a task has been scheduled on a processor with a finish time at time 0. If it has, and the current processor we are considering to schedule it on is isomorphic we continue to the next processor. 
    
* #### State Duplication Avoidance
    If you hash a stack, its hashcode is dependent on the order of things in the stack, when you hash a set, the order doesn't effect the hashcode. This means that, we can detect duplication that arises from swapping the tasks that have been scheduled on two processors. 
    
    In our algorithm, we keep the hash codes of different states and check whether the current state is a duplicate of one that we have searched before.
    
* #### Node equivalence
    Two nodes are equivalent if they have the same duration, they have the same parents and children, and the edge costs between their parents and children are the same. 
    
    For a given state, there is no point in scheduling two identical tasks on the same processor. In our algorithm, when considering if to schedule a task on a processor, we check to see if we have already scheduled an equivalent task.
    

### Edge Cases
    We check for edge cases in our algorithm to ensure that we can sort these edge cases in a faster way than other graphs.

* #### One processor
    If there is only one processor, then all tasks should simply be scheduled sequentially on the processor with no idle time. The finish time of the optimal schedule is the sum of all the durations of the tasks. All we need to do is to find a valid order to schedule the tasks.
