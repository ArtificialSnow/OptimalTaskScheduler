# Milestone 2

The goal of Milestone 2 was to implement an algorithm which finds an optimal scheduling of tasks.
We also created a live visualisation of the algorithm, which can optionally be enabled.
The algorithm was also parallelised to run using a specified number of threads.

For more info on each of these aspects, see below:
